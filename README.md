# Railways Society Integrator (RSI)

Railways Society Integrator is united professional-and-popular space about all types of railway transports around the World, its infrastructure, 
history and and the people who invented and developed them.

## Idea for creation

Do you like trains or any type of railway transport?
There are many publics, webpages, sources, YouTube-channels, societies about it.
But they have a few problems! Look here:
1. Some of them have been inactive for a long time (Its information isn't updated or/and doesn't correspond to reality)
2. Another sources are famous and known only in narrow circles (It's difficult to find them: ...on the latest strings of conclusions in search engines)
3. Others contradict the forth and... 
4. ...make HYPE OUT OF NOTHING!!!

There are also sites that are not only about railways, but they mention them.

But the main problem, in my opinion, is about its quality. There are few high-quality sites and channels that tell in detail about railways and its infrastructure, 
where it is located, how to get to it, and what is interesting nearby.

I decided to try solving that problems by creating RSI.
BUT! Yes, it is so big project for only one programmer.
I started with underground (metro, subway) systems for the first step.

## Structure of RSI

By my plans RSI project will include three parts (levels of accessibility):
* The first level is opened for all users. It looks like an information site about a particular type of railway transport with relevant and reliable information about its operation, 
the cost of services (if it is a transport system or a museum) and location (tied to a city or other locality).
A collection of short articles about him is available. (It is almost created)
* The second level is opened only for authenticated users by emails or social networks. It consists of a collection of large and complete interactive articles 
with many links to related information pages. In addition to articles, there will also be video materials (amateur filming, popular science and documentary films, 
old chronicles), podcasts from the works of authors about this technique, interviews with direct participants in events directly related to this technique: machinists, 
technicians, engineers, designers, etc.
Emphasis will be placed on the wishes and comments of participants in this registration level. There will be an opportunity to order tickets, 
buy them and even exchange them between participants. (The second part is in plans but it will be started creating soon!)
* The third level will require additional authorization or achievement of approval by professionals of comments on articles or positive reviews 
on articles published by participants of the second level of access.
At this level, each of the sections is already directly involved in improving and editing these articles and organizing events in the integrator.
There is an opportunity to talk with the organizers of events and help them;
if the articles turn out to be of a very high level, it becomes possible to speak with them at conferences, publish them in journals, or even enter 
a technical or humanitarian university, depending on the article, as an undergraduate or even a graduate student. (This part exists only in planes)

## Stack of technologies:
* Django Framework (Class- and Functions-Based Views; Python 3 OOP);
* Django REST Framework;
* HTML/CSS;
* Jinja;
* PostgreSQL (in Docker Desktop) and Microsoft SQL Server

## What have I already done?

At the moment I realized registration and authentication system, first accessibility level, currencies exchange by using API json data.

## Why did I not continue RSI project during last months

When I almost had created the first accessibility level I started studying JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke's book "Evoquent JavaScript" and spent a lot of time
on its second edition with big amounts of troubles, before I found its third edition by this link: https://eloquentjavascript.net/.

Now I understand more than before. I started studying JavaScript to use it for RSI project in one of the two famous JS frameworks: Vue.js and React.js.
This is to expand the range of my programmimg abilities.

Now I'm trying to catch up with time in order to start further development of my project as soon as possible.
